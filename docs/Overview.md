<span style="color:red">Display</span>

<span style="color:green">Tower</span>

<span style="color:violet">Turrets</span>

In this section of the documentation it is explained how each of those elements is constructed.  

Each module is controlled by its own Raspberry Pi (with a single Raspberry Pi for every single turret).  The Raspberry Pis are powered by a single 5V power supply unit. For Motorschield separate 12 V power supply was used.

All elements of the game crazy comet are attached to the base plate. Each turret are placed within a circle, so every player has the same chance of hitting the target. 

All connection cables are aligned on the bottom of the base plate. Each turret has at it's position a provided hole for the cables. 

For the ground plane to stand probably three M6 threaded bore holes are provided every 450mm.
