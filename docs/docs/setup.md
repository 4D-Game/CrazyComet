# Setup

To start the game plug in the two power chords connected to the playing field. After about 1 minute the central tower will start to calibrate itself. In the next couple minutes all turrets will begin to light up in blue and the displays will show a round logo.

## Gamepad

The controller can be started by pressing and holding the "home" button until the LEDs start to blink green and blue. Once they stop blinking the gamepad is connected to a turret.

The order in wich the gamepads are connected is always random. You can find out the order by pressing "B" on every gamepad one after another. The turret who lights up green is the one connected to the gamepad.

### No connection

Sometimes one or two controllers won't pair. To fix this problem disconnect and reconnect the USB dongle from the Raspberry Pi which is not connected to any gamepad. The turret light will turn of for some time. After this the turret will start up again.

    If you have limited knowledge about electronics or the game itself, please seek support from someone who does.
