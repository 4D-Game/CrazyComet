### Task
The tower is the central element of the playing field. It is used to move the comets around the playing field so every player has a chance to hit them.


## Construction

### Functionality

The tower consists of a base and an arm with a comet at each end. The arm can be rotated horizontally and tilted vertically. Both motions are created with a stepper motor. The stepper motors are controlled with the Raspberry Pi using a Adafruit Motor Shield.
