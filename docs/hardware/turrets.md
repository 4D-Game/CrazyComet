# Turrets

The turrets are controlled by the player. They are used to "shoot" the comets. In the current setup six turrets are used.

## Construction

### Functionality

The model used for implementing the turrets was found on Thingiverse[^1]. We
chose this model because the design went very well with our initial game idea
and the fundamental movements (Horizontal and vertical rotation of the aiming
part) were given. As said, the main technical functionality of this Prototype
is to rotate horizontal and vertical in order ot give the player a good aiming
experience. One is placed below the base of the turret. The other is placed on
the right side of the top element. In order to detect if the player hit the
comet, a IR-Sensor is used. The model which is used returns a digital signal.
The sensitivity can be tuned with a screw on the back of the sensor.Horizontal
rotation of the aiming part would be indicated with the help of an RGB
NEOPIXEL LED ring.

### Adapted 3D-Models of turrets

### Adaptations

This model was not configured for our servo motors. Therefore, every part of
the model connected to the motor needed to be changed. In addition, the
Blaster Model was created.
- Base: New configuration of the middle part, adapted to fit our servo motor.
- Base_mount: Creating a little motor winding to fit in the base mount.
- Servo_bracket: Adapting the servo bracket to fit our servo motor.
- Turret_legs: Added holes for mounting the Turret to the Base plate.
- Blaster: New Model which held the Laser sensor, In addition, two LEDs are
used to display if the player shot (white) and if he hit (green). Both LEDs are positioned at the tip of the barrel of the turret.
