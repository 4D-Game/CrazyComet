# Display and Sound module

The name of the teams and the points of every team as well as the winner is shown on a display. Each successful hit is accentuated by a sound effect. During the game, the melody ["Awakening Game Polychord phase"](https://freesound.org/people/SSS_Samples/sounds/360906/) and at the end, the song ["Jingle_Win_00"](https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270402/) is played.

## Functionality

The displays are controlled by a Raspberry Pi. For this game two 2.2 TFT SPI 240x320  displays are used. Both displays are connected to the Raspberry Pi via Y-Cables.

The USB sound-card must be connected directly to the USB port Raspberry Pi. Loudspeaker can then be connected to the sound card using a 3.5 mm audio jack. Every Sound-effect used in this game was taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

See the software documentation for information about controlling the [displays](https://4d-game.github.io/Gamecontrol/code-references/hardware/display_hal/) or [audio](https://4d-game.github.io/Gamecontrol/code-references/hardware/sound_hal/).
