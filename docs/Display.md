The display are controlled by the Raspberry-pi. For this game two displays are used. One for every Team. Both displays are connected to the raspberry pi via Y-Cables. For the usage of the sound-card, this card must be connected directly to the Raspberry-pi with 3.5 mm jack plugs. Every Sound-effect used in this game were taken from this website (linl einfÃ¼gen). For the mounting of the displays
